# Hash Tables
## Summary

## Examples

## Time Complexity
A good hash table will complete searching, inserting, and deleting in O(1) and spacing in O(n). The worst case scenario is when every insertion causes a hash collision and the table has to resort to a linear search, in which case the time commplexity becomes O(n). The speed of hash tables gives it a great advantage over other data structures. However, when the size of data is not very large, hash tables become higher cost to implement.
